They touch on various mysteries such as consciousness, life, and gravity, suggesting that a more fundamental understanding could provide insights into these topics. Demas also shares insights about advancements in fusion energy, specifically how they have developed a method to hold plasma in specific shapes for extended periods, which is a significant step in fusion research. Additionally, they mention work on modeling the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons and the potential role of AI in this area. The conversation emphasizes the importance of exploring new frontiers in both physics and technology.\n"

      "the following is a conversation with demus hasabis ceo and co-founder of deepmind a company that has published and builds some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems in the history of computing including alfred zero that learned all by itself to play the game of gold better than any human in the world and alpha fold two that solved protein folding both tasks considered nearly impossible for a very long time demus is widely considered to be one of the most brilliant and impactful humans in the history of artificial intelligence and science and engineering in general this was truly an honor and a pleasure for me to finally sit down with him for this conversation and i'm sure we will talk many times again in the future this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's demis hassabis let's start with a bit of a personal question am i an ai program you wrote to interview people until i get good enough\n",
      "\n",
      "i used to discuss um uh uh what were the sort of founding tenets of deep mind and it was very various things one was um algorithmic advances so deep learning you know jeff hinton and cohen just had just sort of invented that in academia but no one in industry knew about it uh we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled up but also understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri machines and other things so we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and and sort of um representations maybe that the brain uses so as at a systems level not at a implementation level um and then the other big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and it got to a place where it became commoditized mostly through the games industry and and that could be taken advantage of and then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so\n",
      "\n",
      "and how it works this is tough to uh ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything but let's let's try let's try to think to this because you're in a very interesting position where deepmind is the place of some of the most uh brilliant ideas in the history of ai but it's also a place of brilliant engineering so how much of solving intelligence this big goal for deepmind how much of it is science how much is engineering so how much is the algorithms how much is the data how much is the hardware compute infrastructure how much is it the software computer infrastructure yeah um what else is there how much is the human infrastructure and like just the humans interact in certain kinds of ways in all the space of all those ideas how much does maybe like philosophy how much what's the key if um uh if if you were to sort of look back like if we go forward 200 years look back what was the key thing that solved intelligence is that ideas i think it's a combination first\n",
      "\n",
      "ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and you're you're you know it's blue sky research no one knows how to do it you you you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction so so that that was one reason we pushed so hard on that and that's and just going back to your early question about organization the other big thing that i think we innovated with at deepmind to encourage invention and and uh and innovation was the multi-disciplinary organization we built and we still have today so deepmind originally was a confluence of the of the most cutting-edge knowledge in neuroscience with machine learning engineering and mathematics right and and gaming and then since then we built that out even further so we have philosophers here and and uh by you know ethicists but also other types of scientists physicists and so on um and that's what brings together i tried to build a\n"

He mentions recent advancements in fusion research, specifically how they have managed to hold plasma in specific shapes for extended periods, which is a significant step forward in energy production. Additionally, he touches on the challenges of modeling quantum mechanical behavior of electrons and the potential role of AI in this area. The conversation emphasizes the importance of exploring new ideas and solutions in physics and related fields.'"
