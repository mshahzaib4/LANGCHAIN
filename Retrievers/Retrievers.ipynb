      "The United States had been providing military aid and economic assistance to Pakistan for various purposes since 1948. Recently U.S. stopped military aid to Pakistan, which was about US$2 billion per year. With U.S. military assistance suspended in 2018 and civilian aid reduced to about $300 million for 2022, Pakistani authorities have turned to other countries for help.\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "From 1947 to 1958, under civilian leadership, the United States provided Pakistan with modest economic aid and limited military assistance. During this period, Pakistan became a member of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), after a Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement signed in May 1954, which facilitated increased levels of both economic and military aid from the U.S.\n",
      "In 1958, Ayub Khan led Pakistan's first military coup, becoming Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and later President until 1969. During his tenure, the U.S. delivered substantial economic and military aid, despite Pakistan's governance by military regime, and amidst events like the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.\n",
      "Yahya Khan succeeded Ayub in 1969, holding power during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 which led to the secession of East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh. Under Yahya, the U.S. provided adequate economic but minimal military aid.\n",
      "Civilian governance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto resumed from 1971 to 1977, during which the U.S. offered modest economic support and withheld military aid as Pakistan finalized its constitution, establishing a parliamentary democracy.\n",
      "Following another military coup in 1977, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq led the country. In April 1979, President Jimmy Carter halted all aid, excluding food assistance, due to Pakistan's efforts to establish a uranium enrichment facility, following Symington Amendment. Initial U.S. aid was limited, increasing significantly after geopolitical shifts such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the fall of the Shah of Iran. U.S. sanctions imposed in April 1979 due to Pakistan's nuclear activities were lifted by the end of the year in light of these events.\n",
      "Between 1988 and 1999, under civilian and democratic governments, U.S. aid was low, particularly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. The aid was suspended in the 1990s under President George H. W. Bush, who cited concerns over Pakistan's developing nuclear program. Relations between the two countries deteriorated as the U.S. implemented the Pressler Amendment. This amendment led to severe sanctions against Pakistan, exacerbating economic challenges for the country's nascent civilian government. Consequently, all forms of bilateral aid from the U.S. to Pakistan were halted. The once expansive operations of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pakistan, which had employed over 1,000 staff across the country, were dramatically reduced almost overnight. Further complications arose from U.S. sanctions following Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998, which were conducted in response to similar tests by India.\n",
      "The return of military rule under Pervez Musharraf from 1999 to 2008 initially saw little U.S. economic or military aid. However, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, all U.S. sanctions were removed, and Pakistan, having aligned with the U.S. in the War on Terror, received substantial increases in both economic and military assistance.\n",
      "On June 16, 2009, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the Kerry-Lugar Bill. The bipartisan act authorized an annual provision of $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Pakistan, aimed at fostering enhanced bilateral relations.\n",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration suspended more than one-third of all military assistance, totaling approximately $800 million due to Osama bin Laden-related controversy. This reduction encompassed funds designated for military hardw...\n",

      "The Islamic Republic of Pakistan emerged as an independent country through the partition of India in August 1947 and was admitted as a United Nations member state in September 1947. It is currently the second-largest country within the Muslim world in terms of population, and is also the only Muslim-majority country in possession of nuclear weapons. De facto, the country shares direct land borders with India, Iran, Afghanistan, and China.\n",
      "The country has extensive trade relations with the European Union and with several countries globally. As of 2023, Pakistan does not recognize two other United Nations member states (Armenia and Israel) and its ties with India remain frozen since 2019.\n",
      "From a geopolitical perspective, Pakistan's location is strategically important as it is situated at the crossroads of major maritime and land transit routes between the Middle East and South Asia, while also serving as a bridge between the Arabian Sea and the energy-rich regions of Central Asia. Since the partition of India, the Kashmir conflict has defined the Indiaâ€“Pakistan relationship: the two countries claim each other's zones of control in Kashmir, but are separated by a ceasefire boundary known as the Line of Control. Pakistan has close bilateral ties with China and the Muslim world, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf Arab countries. As a part of the First World during the Cold War, Pakistan closely cooperated with the United States to combat the global influence of the Soviet Union, though this relationship later became strained over the course of the War on Terror. Pakistan is an active member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.king\n",

      "== Foreign policy of Pakistan ==\n",
      "Pakistan's foreign policy seeks the 'promotion of Pakistan as a dynamic, progressive, moderate, and democratic Islamic country; developing friendly relations with all countries of the world, especially major powers and immediate neighbors; consolidating our commercial and economic cooperation with international community.\"\n",
      "Pakistan's foreign policy is meant to formalize and define its interactions with foreign nations and standardize interactions with organizations, corporations and individual citizens. Backed by the semi-agricultural and semi-industrialized economy, Pakistan is the 44th largest (nominal GDP, 2025) and 26th largest (purchasing) economic power and 7th largest military in the world in terms of active personnel, with a defense budget of US$10.2 billion (2024), 2.7% of its GDP (2024). The Foreign Minister of Pakistan is the official charged with state-to-state diplomacy, although the Prime minister maintains an ultimate authority over foreign policy. The state foreign policy includes defining the national interest, as well as the economic interest and strategies chosen both to safeguard that and to achieve its policy goals. Following the general election held in May 2013, Tariq Fatimi and NSA Sartaj Aziz were designated as advisers to the Prime Minister on foreign and strategic policies. After the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif's government in July 2017, Khawaja Muhammad Asif held the portfolio of foreign minister under the premiership of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. After the victory of Imran Khan Niazi in the Pakistan General Elections 2018, Shah Mehmood Qureshi was named the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Subsequently, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari became foreign minister after the political crisis-a position previously held by his grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and Hina Rabbani Khar.\n",
